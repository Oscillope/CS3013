Project 3
=========

To compile, run `make`. To clean build files, run `make clean`. Each problem can be compiled individually using `make problem1` and `make problem2`, respectively.

Compilation will generate two executables, `./problem1` and `./problem2`.

Known Bugs
----------

None that we could find. We tested about 2000 cars running through the intersection as well as several hours worth of pirates and ninjas.
